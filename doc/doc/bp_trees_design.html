    This section provides a brief discussion of the properties and implementation 
    details of the augmented B+ trees. It aims to help programmers 
    to better understand the specifics of new containers and how to use 
    them in algorithms. The discussion covers both array based and 
    dynamically allocated B+ trees. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Advantages of B+ trees
    </h4>

    <p>
    A B+ tree is a data structure that supports efficient search, retrieval and 
    update operations of stored information. A B+ tree can be regarded as an improved 
    variant of a B-tree, which was originally developed for systems with external 
    storage [<a href="bibliography.html">2</a>]. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The main problem of these B-trees is their inefficiency in range queries and 
    sequential processing of data. In a B-tree representing a sorted list a tree 
    traversal algorithm that finds a next element in the worst case visits 
    <i>O(log N)</i> nodes at different levels of the tree. Crossing levels in these 
    trees has a very high cost due to a huge difference in access time between 
    the disks and RAM.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For B-trees in main memory, as well as for red-black trees, the cost of crossing 
    levels is significantly lower than in external storage trees and sequential processing 
    is relatively fast. Nevertheless, the structure of nodes remains the same and some 
    adjacent elements of a sorted list are connected through a path of length <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    For dynamically allocated trees locality of reference is relatively poor.     
    Thus, sequential processing in these trees is less efficient than in linear data 
    structures, which guarantee that an algorithm can move to a next element in constant time. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A B+ tree solves these inefficiency problems by combining two data structures with 
    different properties. User data are stored in a linear structure such as a linked list  
    that implements simple and efficient sequential access to the data. The other data 
    structure is a B-tree, which is connected to the linear structure. This tree stores only 
    keys and supports fast search and random access to the data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The B+ trees have a number of practically important advantages. This class 
    of data structures is one of the most thoroughly studied at present. 
    There are many implementations of B+ trees, which gain from specific 
    system optimizations. 
    These trees offer a high degree of flexibility in the choice of a linear data 
    structure for the deepest level and a specific B-tree for internal nodes and levels. 
    For example, 
    in systems for external searching a B+ trees can have a very complex structure 
    with one node representing another data structure such as a binary search tree. 
    On the other hand, 
    a B+ tree designed to work in main memory can be implemented as a dynamically 
    allocated or an array based data structure with the complexity reduced to 
    minimal in order to support required algorithms and interfaces only. 
    </p>

    <p>    
    The B+ trees of this project are level-linked variants of this data structure, 
    for more details see [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>] and below. 
    Level-linked B+ trees are particularly attractive for the development of new STL 
    containers, since they can be implemented in RAM using simple linear 
    topologies of linked lists not only for external nodes, but also for any other level 
    of a tree. Thus, algorithms gain the advantage of efficient access to data stored 
    in both external and internal nodes. In addition to this, these B+ trees 
    improve performance of algorithms through the method of augmenting data 
    structures [<a href="bibliography.html">4</a>]. 
    </p>


    <a name="types_nodes"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Types of internal and external nodes
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The implementation of a B+ tree requires different types of nodes, since user data 
    are stored only in external nodes arranged into a linear data structure. 
    In the augmented B+ trees an external node is represented by a type, which is 
    named light node, since a node of this type contains the minimum of required data. 
    In dynamically allocated B+ trees a light node stores a container element and 
    three links to adjacent nodes. 
    In array based B+ trees the pointer arithmetic provides the efficient 
    constant time access to any element inside an array. 
    It makes links to previous and next nodes redundant and, thus, 
    allows for saving space required for an array based B+ tree. 
    </p>
    
    <p>    
    An internal node is represented by a heavy node. 
    A node of this type contains four links to support a level-linked variant of 
    a B+ tree and special implementation data, which improve the performance 
    of algorithms. Instead of a key, a heavy node stores a pointer to a light node. 
    This pointer is used both for connectivity and for access to a container element.
    The name heavy node has been selected, since a node of this type stores more 
    information than a light node. Nevertheless, in applications it is possible that a 
    light node requires more space than a heavy node. The size of a light node depends 
    on the size of a container element stored in the node, whereas the size of a heavy 
    node is constant, since this node includes only a pointer to a light node.
    </p>
    
    <a name="connect"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Connectivity of nodes
    </h4>

    <p>
    The augmented B+ trees are implemented as multi-linked data structures 
    using a representation similar to leftmost child, 
    right sibling representation of a multi-way tree. 
    Each internal node of these B+ trees contains four links pointing to 
    its right sibling, left sibling, parent and leftmost child. 
    A group of child nodes in an internal level forms a doubly linked list. 
    This connectivity gives the advantage of simple and fast 
    sequential access to data in these nodes. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>    
    A group of external child nodes also forms a linear data structure. 
    In a dynamically allocated B+ tree the group is represented by 
    a doubly linked list. In an array based B+ tree the same group 
    is represented by an array of light nodes. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>    
    Unlike internal nodes, external nodes do not contain redundant 
    links to children; however, they can support links to parents. 
    This type of link improves the efficiency of the bottom up processing, 
    which updates cached algorithmic data in internal nodes, when a tree is modified. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>    
    An internal node can be a parent to the children, which are 
    a group of either internal or external nodes. 
    In the latter case, a link to the leftmost child is supported 
    through a pointer to an external node, 
    which is also used to obtain a value of a container element.    
    </p>


    <a name="balance"></a>    
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Balance
    </h4>

    <p>
    For a B+ tree with a minimum degree of a node <i>t</i> (<i>t</i> >= 2) the bounds 
    on the number of children are defined and implemented as follows. Each internal node 
    can have at most 2<i>t</i> children and at least <i>t</i> children. The number of 
    children for an internal node can be less than <i>t</i> if this node is the root, 
    including the case when the total number of user elements stored in external nodes 
    is also less than <i>t</i>.    
    </p>

    <p>
    The array based B+ tree can support two minimum degree parameters: 
    one for internal dynamically allocated nodes and one for external nodes 
    stored in arrays of the deepest level of a tree. The higher efficiency 
    of the pointer arithmetic, the greater the value of the minimum degree 
    can be set for an external level. This property of the array based B+ trees 
    is useful to increase locality of reference and improve performance of algorithms. 
    </p>


    <a name="lev_linked"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Level-linked structure
    </h4>

    <p>
    In a B+ tree all external nodes have the same depth. This property makes a B+ tree 
    globally balanced and enables the modification of the structure, which is known as a 
    level-linked B+ tree [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>]. A B+ tree of this type 
    arranges internal nodes of one level into a linked list.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The level-linked connectivity provides algorithms the advantage of efficient sequential 
    access to internal nodes and to data stored in these nodes at every level of the tree. 
    It reduces the maximum cost of visiting a neighbour node at the same level from 
    <i>O(log N)</i> using a tree traversal algorithm to <i>O(1)</i> using a level link.
    </p>

    <p>
    As an algorithm moves up the tree, the number of nodes in every level decreases with 
    the mean frequency 3<i>t</i>/2. Simultaneously, the number of external nodes with 
    container elements connected to an internal node through child-parent links increases 
    by the same factor. Thus, an algorithm can use the upper levels of the tree in order to 
    vary the length and precision of iteration steps. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The current augmented B+ trees support level-linked structure of internal levels 
    through links between the rightmost node of a child group with the leftmost 
    node of the next child group at the same level. In a dynamically allocated B+ tree 
    the deepest level of external nodes represents a doubly linked list. 
    In an array based B+ tree every child group of external nodes is stored inside one array. 
    The pointer arithmetic provides efficient access to any element inside an array. 
    The connectivity between adjacent groups of external nodes 
    is supported through links to nodes of the deepest internal level. 
    </p>


    <a name="data_scheme"></a>    
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Data scheme
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    B+ trees allow various schemes of data association with internal nodes 
    for the same structure and user data stored in the deepest level of 
    external nodes. This fact makes the method of augmenting data 
    structures [<a href="bibliography.html">4</a>], see the chapter 
    &quot;Augmenting Data Structures&quot;, particularly attractive for B+ trees. 
    It improves the efficiency of algorithms by eliminating unnecessary 
    searches and recalculations of required data. 
    </p>                            
    
    <p>
    The augmented B+ trees are designed to extend the functionality of search trees. 
    The new functionality and improved efficiency of algorithms are achieved by 
    storing in the internal nodes of these trees not only keys of container elements, 
    but also special implementation data. The additional data can have some effect on 
    the space usage, however, they do not change the theoretical limit of the space 
    requirement to store a B+ tree, which is <i>O(N)</i>. 
    Regardless of a specific data scheme the augmented B+ trees 
    have the same structure of internal and external nodes. 
    The balanced augmented B+ trees grow and contract in the same way 
    as basic search trees. 
    </p>                            
    
    <p>
    In every augmented B+ tree that supports random access iterators 
    an internal node contains a counter of external nodes 
    with user elements stored in a container. 
    For the deepest level of internal nodes this parameter represents 
    the number of children in one group of external nodes. 
    For internal nodes in all other levels the value of this parameter 
    in a parent node is equal to the sum of counters stored in its children. 
    An algorithm can efficiently obtain and update 
    these counters using the level-linked structure of the tree. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The values of the counters of the container elements are independent of 
    specific user and implementation data stored in external and internal nodes of the tree. 
    These values reflect only the structural relationships between the nodes of the tree. 
    This is why the counters data along with the connectivity of nodes can be regarded as 
    an independent substructure of indices. 
    The following figure shows the structure of indices of an array based B+ tree.

                edges, arrows - directed child-parent edges. 
                The deepest level of the B+ tree implements a partition of the array into 
                a list of sub-arrays. Values in internal nodes of the B+ tree represent 
                counters of elements. Empty cells in sub-arrays of external nodes do not 
                store container elements. They are reserved for new elements to be 
                inserted into the tree. The dashed lines connect first elements in sub-arrays of 
                external nodes of the tree with corresponding elements in the array.

    <p>
    The method of augmenting data structures can be applied to one data structure 
    more than one time. This project uses double augmenting to implement the efficient 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>, which has computational cost <i>O(log N)</i> 
    in the worst case. 
    This performance has been achieved by adding to every internal node a new datum, 
    which represents a sum of consecutive elements stored in external nodes. 
    For the deepest level of internal nodes a parent stores a sum of values of 
    the container elements of its external child nodes. For all other levels of 
    the internal nodes of the tree every parent stores a sum, which is equal to 
    a sum of sum values stored in its children. When an algorithm moves up the tree 
    from a child to its parent, it obtains a sum value of a quickly increasing 
    number of container elements stored in external nodes.

    <p>
    Unlike the substructure of indices, the substructure of sums depends on the values of 
    container elements stored in the external nodes of the tree. The specific values of 
    sum data in internal nodes are also affected by the structural relationships between nodes. 
    For this reason, the substructures of indices and sums have a very close similarity. In the 
    case when each element of a container has the value 1, these two substructures become identical. 
    In this respect, the substructure of sums supersedes the substructures of indices.
    </p>
    

    <a name="eff_accum"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    </h4>
   
    <p>
    The efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> represents a finger search 
    [<a href="bibliography.html">3</a>], 
    The start and end positions are specified by two input iterators 
    that provide pointers to corresponding external nodes. 
    The algorithm uses the level-linked substructure of indices 
    in order to find between these two external nodes a path, 
    which has the minimum or close to the minimum number of edges. 
    For distant external nodes the path goes through internal nodes, 
    which store pre-calculated sums of container elements. 
    The required sum of consecutive elements is obtained 
    by summing up the values of elements in external nodes and 
    the cached sum values in internal nodes when this algorithm moves to 
    a next node at the same level of the tree or, in other words, passes 
    through a horizontal link.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The finger search algorithm has cost <i>O(log D)</i>, where <i>D</i> 
    is the number of consecutive container elements. This algorithm also 
    provides high accuracy of the calculated sum. Its accuracy is practically 
    the same as that of the standard algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>, 
    which sums up values of container elements in the forward sequential order.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note that the member function <code>accumulate()</code> of one basic container 
    supports many types of STL containers: sequences and associative containers. 
    This approach is general, since at the implementation level of this efficient 
    algorithm every container is processed as a sequence through the substructure of 
    indices, which is independent of the other substructure of sums. 
    The efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> demonstrates an important 
    aspect of the augmented B+ trees - the ability to simultaneously support 
    two substructures of two data sets associated with container elements. 
    </p>     


    <a name="eff_splice"></a>    
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Efficient <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code> algorithms
    </h4>

    <p>
    The augmented B+ trees support the C++ standard <code>splice()</code> 
    functions as well as non-standard <code>split()</code> functions. 
    These functions are very efficient, since they are based on local 
    structural modifications of these trees. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>splice()</code> functions of the augmented B+ trees have been 
    implemented through algorithms that join and split trees. 
    These algorithms take advantage of the relatively 
    simple level-linked structure of the augmented B+ trees. 
    Every internal level of these trees represents a doubly linked list. 
    A structural modification of join or split is first applied to 
    every horizontal list of the trees involved. 
    After that, every level of the B+ trees is tested for the balance 
    in groups of child nodes modified by the join or cut operation. 
    Testing and restoring the balance are local operations for every level of the trees. 
    Since these algorithms are applied to every level of the B+ trees, 
    the basic functions that join and split trees have logarithmic computational cost. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>splice()</code> is a member function of <code>sequence</code> only, 
    because this function does not preserve the order of container elements. 
    On the other hand, the split operation does not violate the ordering in 
    modified containers. This is why it is a general operation that can be 
    supported by sequences and accociative containers. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Both split and splice operations do not change the total number of elements 
    in containers involved before and after an operation. This property enables 
    the implementation of a split operation through a splice operation 
    using an empty container. 
    However, the <code>splice()</code> member function is not safe for 
    associative containers, thus, the <code>split()</code> member function 
    should be directly added to the interfces of all containers. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    support the member function <code>merge()</code>. 
    This function implements a join operation for associative containers 
    with multiple equivalent elements, since it does not change 
    the total number of elements in the containers involved. 
    For containers with unique elements the function has 
    the effect of the union operation. 
    In special cases the function <code>merge()</code> 
    is equivalent to the <code>splice()</code> function. 
    This fact has been used at the implementation level 
    to achieve the best performance. 
    Note that in the C++ standard library the function <code>merge()</code> 
    is supported by the container <code>std::list</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Dynamically allocated linked lists provide various efficient splice 
    operations through the change of the connectivity between a few nodes only. 
    The <code>splice()</code> functions of <code>std::list</code> have 
    constant computational cost except for the one function 
    </p>
<pre>
    void splice(iterator pos, list& x, iterator first, iterator last);
</pre>
    <p>
    which has linear cost. The inefficiency is caused by counting of inserted 
    and removed elements in order to comply with the C++ standard requirement 
    that the <code>size()</code> function has constant cost. 
    The same problem of linear cost of recounting of moved elements arises in CGAL 
    with red black trees that support split and join operations of 
    <a href="http://www.cgal.org/Manual/latest/doc_html/cgal_manual/STL_Extension_ref/Class_Multiset.html">
    <code>Multiset</code></a>. 
    Note that both discussed containers provide bidirectional iterators only. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This inefficiency problem shows that the ability of the augmented B+ trees 
    to support random access iterators plays the crucial role in achieving 
    the high efficiency of <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code> 
    functions that can move any number of consecutive 
    elements in logarithmic time. Using random access iterators 
    algorithms obtain the number of moved elements in constant time.

    or update the value of a container element. The most general method is 
    to write a new value to an element through an iterator: <code>*iter = val_new</code>. 
    In addition to this, <code>vector</code> and <code>deque</code> support the subscript 
    <code>operator[ ]</code> and the member function <code>at()</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    For the new containers based on augmented data structures these methods are safe 
    only for <code>sequence</code> using the class <code>bp_tree_array</code>. 
    This data structure stores container elements only in the external nodes of 
    the deepest level. The operation, which writes a new value to an element in 
    an external node through an iterator, is identical to such an operation in 
    any linear data structure and has constant computational cost. After the element 
    has been modified, all connected internal nodes operate with the new value, 
    since they access the modified element through pointers to the external node. 
    </p>

    <p>
    For the containers based on the class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code> 
    the support for correct write operations is more complex. 
    This B+ tree stores in its internal nodes additional sum data 
    required for the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. 
    A write operation, which changes the value of an element in an external node 
    only, makes the additional sum data invalid in a number of internal  nodes. 
    The simple write operation is unsafe for all types of containers based on the 
    class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code>. In order to maintain the tree data valid, 
    the change in the element value must be properly reflected in the sum data 
    in a chain of parent nodes at every level of the tree. 
    For this reason in the class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code> 
    the safe write operation has cost <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The problem of unsafe write operations can arise in the future 
    for augmented data structures implementing new STL extensions or
    new efficient algorithms. The member function 
    </p>
<pre>    
    std::pair&lt;iterator, bool&gt;
    write ( iterator  pos , const value_type &  val_new ) ;
</pre>    
    <p>
    has been added to address all types of the data invalidation problems 
    that can be caused by the standard write methods. This function guarantees 
    that a container remains in a valid state after an element has been modified. 
    It can be used in code instead of the discussed above operations, 
    such as <code>*iter=val_new</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    This member function is supported by every STL container of 
    the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> with the computational 
    complexity varying from <i>O(1)</i> to <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    The effect of this function for each container type 
    is equivalent to two operations that erase an old element 
    pointed to by an input iterator and insert a new element. 
    The function does not change the number of elements in a container. 
    Algorithms using this function gain the additional advantage of being able 
    to implement more generic algorithms.

    Array based B+ trees as enhanced allocators 
    </h4>

    <p>
    The array based B+ trees of this project have a number of properties that 
    make them similar to pool allocators [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>]. 
    This type of C++ allocator is frequently used to improve performance of 
    dynamically allocated data structures, such as linked lists or red black trees.
    </p>

    <p>
    A pool allocator normally represents a simple linked list of memory blocks. 
    An array based B+ tree has basically the same structure of the deepest level 
    when the number of container elements is relatively small. The tree constructs 
    and stores arrays of light nodes with container elements in contiguous regions of 
    memory blocks. As a user algorithm adds new elements, the complexity of 
    the structure of the B+ tree increases. It constructs new levels of internal nodes 
    in order to deliver the best possible performance of container operations. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The dynamics of memory blocks and elements stored in an array based B+ tree and 
    in a pool allocator are identical. A B+ tree allocates large memory blocks and 
    uses them to control the lifetime of container elements. 
    The elements are created and destroyed in the memory space owned by the tree 
    through the customized allocation and deallocation of container elements that is 
    more efficient than  general C++ operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>. 
    These B+ trees minimize the frequency of costly system allocations and 
    deallocations of memory blocks. 
    If the total number of elements in a memory block does not exceed 
    its capacity limit, the block can be used to construct and destroy 
    an unlimited number of container elements before the block is freed. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Because of these structural and dynamical properties, an array based B+ tree 
    represents an enhanced and optimized allocator. Alternatively, an array 
    based B+ tree can be regarded as a data structure that implements 
    the functionality of an allocator using its own memory space. 
    </p>


    <p>
    However, an array based B+ tree does not guarantee that a container element will be 
    stored in a memory region that remains unchanged for the whole lifetime of the element. 
    These B+ trees are optimized for the best performance through 
    the contiguous arrangement of container elements in memory blocks. 
    In order to avoid gaps and minimize memory fragmentation update operations 
    can move container elements inside memory blocks. 
    </p>

    Main difference between dynamically allocated and array based B+ trees
    </h4>

    <p>
    The dynamically allocated augmented B+ trees require a pointer machine 
    and provide efficient sequential and random access to container elements. 
    In some aspect, these data structures implement the pointer arithmetic. 
    The array based augmented B+ trees take advantage of the pointer arithmetic 
    provided by a system and deliver significantly better performance 
    for many container operations against equivalent variants of 
    dynamically allocated trees. 
    </p>

    <p>
    An array based B+ tree implements a general and portable partition of 
    an array into a list of sub-arrays connected to a B-tree. 
    These B+ trees maximize locality of reference by storing 
    consecutive container elements in contiguous memory regions. 
    However, as with many array based data structures, 
    the performance benefit comes at the expense of the 
    invalidation of random access iterators by update operations.
