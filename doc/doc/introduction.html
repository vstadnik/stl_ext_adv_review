    Motivation
    </h4>

    <p>
    The C++ standard library [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>] has proven 
    to be very effective in the development of various programming solutions. 
    The success of this library is due to its solid theoretical framework and 
    high quality of its design and implementations. 
    Despite all of these well known advantages, 
    the library has a number of limitations associated with 
    the efficiency of the container algorithms and bidirectional iterators. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    The C++ standard library increases its usefulness by providing various 
    types of specialized containers [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>]. 
    In particular, it includes three sequences: <code>vector</code>, 
    <code>deque</code> and <code>list</code>. 
    Each of these sequences has a limited application area due to having 
    at least one inefficient operation with linear running time. 
    For <code>vector</code> and <code>deque</code>, these are the member functions 
    <code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code> for a single element. 
    <code>list</code> supports bidirectional iterators, which are inefficient 
    in algorithms that access elements at random or distant positions. 
    Associative containers provide efficient access to elements by their keys, 
    however, access to elements by their positions 
    is even less efficient than in <code>list</code>. 
    Many algorithms of associative containers based on 
    dynamically allocated red black trees are outperformed by 
    the same algorithms using array based data structures. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The efficient support of move semantics by the containers of the C++03 
    standard library is reduced to the member function <code>swap()</code>. 
    The container <code>std::list</code> provides three member 
    functions <code>splice()</code> that belong to the same group 
    of the move semantics functions as the function <code>swap()</code>. 
    The complexity of these functions is constant in two special cases, 
    however, in the general case the function <code>splice()</code> 
    has linear complexity. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The advanced data structures can help solve these problems and 
    extend the STL facilities through new efficient algorithms. 
    These data structures have a great potential in achieving 
    high levels of performance and generalization of algorithms 
    for a wide range of applications.

    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Overview of namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    </h4>

    <p>    
    The C++ standard library specifies the interfaces of the container and 
    iterator types and allows various implementation alternatives 
    using the most efficient data structures and suitable design patterns. 
    The class of advanced data structures is much wider than the class of 
    linear data structures and basic search trees used to formulate 
    the requirements for the C++ standard containers and iterators. 
    The augmented B+ and red black trees appear to be particularly 
    attractive for the extension of the STL facilities. 
    These data structures can be used to develop general and 
    specialized containers with random and bidirectional iterators 
    as well as to improve the performance of specific algorithms. 
    One advanced data structure can support a number of interfaces of 
    the C++ standard containers and can add new efficient extensions. 
    For these reasons, all the classes of STL containers 
    of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> are container 
    adapters with the behaviour and performance guarantees 
    defined by the underlying containers. Most of the member 
    functions of a container adapter simply call the corresponding 
    member functions of an underlying container. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    The namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> offers five class templates 
    that support interfaces of the C++03 standard containers:     
    </p>    
<pre>
    sequence , 
    map      , 
    multimap , 
    set      , 
    multiset ;
</pre>
    <p>
    The class <code>sequence</code> defines a union of interfaces of three 
    STL containers: <code>vector</code>, <code>list</code> and <code>deque</code>. 
    All other classes implement interfaces of the matching C++03 standard 
    associative containers. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the current version of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    the advanced data structures supporting 
    the interfaces of the C++03 standard containers 
    are represented by two augmented array based B+ trees. 
    In a class of a container adapter a template-argument 
    for a template-parameter of a basic container 
    type can be one of the following classes:
    </p>
<pre>
    bp_tree_array     , 
    bp_tree_array_acc ; 
</pre>

    <p>
    Every of these two classes can be used to generate an STL 
    container class from any sequence and associative container adapter. 
    Thus, the current version of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    can be used to instantiate 10 classes of STL containers. 
    The previously developed 
    <a href="https://github.com/vstadnik/stl_ext_adv">dynamically allocated B+ trees</a> 
    have been excluded, because they are less efficient than 
    the array based B+ trees. With those classes of basic containers 
    the total number of STL containers would be 24. 
    These B+ trees can be added in the future. 
    </p>

    <h4>
    Class <code>bp_tree_array</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
    The class <code>bp_tree_array</code> implements a general purpose 
    array based sequence. For a wide range of applications 
    this class represents the default basic container of 
    the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code>. Any STL container 
    adapter using the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    obtains random access iterators and many efficient 
    member functions with logarithmic complexity. 
    The B+ tree of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> can 
    store elements with multiple or unique keys in the order 
    specified by a comparison object. Thus, associative 
    containers using the class <code>bp_tree_array</code>    
    can take advantage of the efficient algorithms developed 
    for sequences and random access iterators. 
    </p>    

   
    <h4>
    Container <code>sequence</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
    The class <code>std_ext_adv::sequence</code> 
    supports the union of interfaces of 
    the C++03 sequence containers: <code>std::list</code>, 
    <code>std::deque</code> and <code>std::vector</code>. 
    This new container can replace in algorithms 
    any of these standard containers. 
    A <code>sequence</code> supports:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>random access iterators. 
    <li>logarithmic time insert and erase operations for a single element anywhere within the container. 
    <li>logarithmic time splice and split operations for any ranges of consecutive elements and any positions in the containers involved. 
    </ul>

    
    <h4>
    Associative containers
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    All the associative containers of the 
    namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> provide  
    equally efficient access to elements by their keys 
    and by positions. These containers support: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>logarithmic time search operations using keys of the container elements. 
    <li>random access iterators. 
    <li>logarithmic time insert and erase operations for a single element anywhere within the container. 
    <li>logarithmic time split operations for any ranges of consecutive elements and any positions in the containers involved. 
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4>
    Move semantics
    </h4>    
    <p>
    The key feature of the move semantics functions of sequences is that 
    they do not change the total number of elements in the containers involved. 
    The group of these functions in the C++03 is represented by the 
    <code>swap()</code> and <code>splice()</code> functions, 
    see the proposal to add move semantics 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1377.htm">N1377</a>. 
    The latter function is supported by <code>std::list</code> only 
    and has linear complexity for an arbitrary range of elements. 
    The sequences of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> extend 
    move semantics of the standard containers by providing 
    the member functions <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code> 
    that guarantee logarithmic complexity in the worst case. 
    </p>        
    <p>
    All the associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    support the member function <code>split()</code> in the same way as 
    sequences. However, instead of the function <code>splice()</code>, 
    these containers provide the member function <code>merge()</code>. 
    For associative containers with multiple equivalent elements this 
    function has the same effect as the function <code>splice()</code>. 
    For associative containers that store unique elements the function 
    <code>merge()</code> has the effect of the union operation. 
    In the special cases that are implemented through the function 
    <code>splice()</code> the complexity of the function <code>merge</code> 
    is logarithmic. 
    </p>        


    <h4>
    Efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>
    </h4>
    <p>
    The class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code> adds to 
    the functionality of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    the efficient algorithm for the member function 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. The function calculates the sum of 
    the values of consecutive container elements using 
    <i>O(log N)</i> operations in the worst case, 
    where <i>N</i> is the number of the consecutive elements. 
    The function can be used through every STL container adapter.         
    This algorithm is fundamental to many practically important 
    applications, such as the numerical integration, the data 
    analysis, the statistics etc., see the section 
    <a href="examples.html">Examples</a> for more details. 
    </p>


    <h4>
    Advantage of pointer arithmetic
    </h4>
    <p>
    An array based B+ tree of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    implements a partition of an array into a list of sub-arrays 
    connected to a B-tree. In some aspects, the tree represents 
    an enhanced pool allocator. Compared to 
    <a href="https://github.com/vstadnik/stl_ext_adv">dynamically allocated B+ trees</a>,  
    the array based B+ trees require less space, 
    improve locality of reference and 
    offer much more efficient access to data. 
    They support many algorithms with the level of performance 
    close to other array based containers, 
    such as <code>std::vector</code>. 
    Many of the proposed STL extensions with a bit different 
    performance guarantees can be achieved using the augmented 
    red black trees. However, these data structures have 
    a major limitation of not being able to take advantage of 
    the pointer arithmetic. 
    </p>
    
        
    <h4>
    Improved representation of sequences
    </h4>

    <p>
    The fact that one basic container of the namespace 
    <code>std_ext_adv</code> supports all the types of 
    the C++03 sequences and associative containers shows 
    the potential of the advanced data structures. 
    These B+ trees  provide more consistent interfaces of 
    the sequences and associative containers and improve 
    the representation of a mathematical sequence. 
    Note that in the C++ standard library even sequences are not 
    completely interchangeable, since there are differences 
    in the interfaces of these containers due to inefficiencies 
    of some basic operations. 
    </p>


    <h4>
    Extension of STL application area
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The increase in the number of containers supporting STL 
    interfaces with new efficient algorithms is an important factor 
    for the extension of the application area of the C++ standard library. 
    The new containers supersede the specialized STL containers, 
    first of all sequences, with reduced interfaces, less efficient 
    member functions and bidirectional iterators. 
    Thus, they can improve the performance of existing  
    algorithms using the standard containers with at least one 
    relatively inefficient operation. 
    </p>

    <p>    
    The wide set of the efficient member functions offered by 
    the new containers makes them particularly beneficial 
    for algorithms that use various operations of sequential and 
    random access and frequently update data stored in a container.
    In the general case, the wider the set of operations 
    required in a user algorithm the more significant 
    should be the performance gain provided by 
    the new containers against the C++ standard containers. 
    The algorithms that use a small set of container operations 
    will benefit from the specialized containers, such as 
    <code>std::vector</code>, that offer the most efficient 
    member functions and iterators for specific applications.

    Performance notes 
    </h4>

    <p>
    Access to a single element of a <code>sequence</code> through 
    the subscript <code>operator[ ]</code> or the member function 
    <code>at()</code> has cost <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case, 
    where <i>N</i> is the container size. Thus, the total cost of 
    sequential processing of all the <code>sequence</code> elements 
    through this operator and member function can reach <i>O(N log N)</i>. 
    For the best performance of sequential processing that guarantees 
    cost <i>O(N)</i> algorithms should access elements through an iterator. 
    This method also offers the advantage of being generic, 
    since it can be used not only with a <code>sequence</code>, 
    but also with the associative containers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In addition to this, in algorithms that visit distant elements 
    the random access iterators of the array based B+ trees 
    are less efficient than iterators of <code>std::vector</code>. 
    The operators <code>{+=, -=, +, -}</code>, which change 
    the position of a random access iterator of a B+ tree, 
    in the worst case have computational cost <i>O(log N)</i>.
