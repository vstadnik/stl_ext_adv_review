    Motivation
    </h4>

    <p>
    The C++ standard library [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>] has proven 
    to be very effective in the development of various programming solutions. 
    The success of this library is due to its solid theoretical framework and 
    high quality of its design and implementations. 
    Despite these well known advantages, the library has 
    a number of limitations associated with inefficiencies of 
    container algorithms and bidirectional iterators. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    The C++ standard library increases its usefulness by providing various 
    types of specialized containers [<a href="bibliography.html">1</a>]. 
    In particular, it includes three sequences: <code>vector</code>, 
    <code>deque</code> and <code>list</code>. 
    Each of these sequences has a limited application area due to having 
    at least one inefficient operation with linear running time. 
    For <code>vector</code> and <code>deque</code>, these are the member functions 
    <code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code> for a single element. 
    <code>list</code> supports bidirectional iterators, which are inefficient 
    in algorithms that access elements at random or distant positions. 
    Associative containers provide efficient access to elements by their keys, 
    however, access to elements by their positions 
    is even less efficient than in <code>list</code>. 
    Many algorithms of associative containers based on 
    dynamically allocated red black trees are outperformed by 
    the matching algorithms using array based data structures. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The efficient support of move semantics by the containers of the C++03 
    standard library is essentially reduced to the member function <code>swap()</code> 
    despite the fact that <code>std::list</code> provides three member functions 
    <code>splice()</code> that belong to the same group of the move semantics 
    functions as the function <code>swap()</code>. The complexity of these 
    <code>splice()</code> functions is constant in two special cases only. 
    In the general case this function has linear complexity. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The inefficiencies of data structures used to specify the C++ STL 
    have a significant effect on interfaces of the standard containers. 
    Generally, the STL prohibits inefficient operations and facilities, 
    but some exceptions are allowed. This approach creates a problem of 
    inconsistent interfaces. For example, unlike other sequences, 
    <code>std::vector</code> does not support the <code>push_front()</code> 
    and <code>pop_front()</code> functions, but it supports general 
    functions <code>insert()</code> and <code>erase()</code> a single 
    element anywhere within a container even though all of these functions 
    have the same linear running time. 
    </p>

    <p>
    As a result of the various differences in computational complexities 
    of operations and inconsistencies of interfaces, the standard containers 
    are not completely interchangeable and have a limited capacity of 
    supporting general algorithms. The most efficient programming solutions 
    dot not allow a simple replacement of a standard container. 
    The generalization of such solutions requires the development of 
    an additional layer of software that encapulates container specific 
    code in user defined types. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The importance and benefit of interchangeable STL containers 
    follow from the performance analysis of algorithms. 
    The running time of an algorithm is determined by complexities 
    and frequencies of supporting operations. Relatively low 
    frequencies of inefficient operations do not cause a performance 
    problem. These operations can extend interfaces of the standard 
    containers, since they are beneficial for many algorithms. 
    When frequencies of supporting operations increase, inefficient operations 
    make the most significant contribution to the total computational cost. 
    For this reason a specialized container with many efficient operations 
    and just one inefficient operation can cause a performance bottleneck. 
    The replacement of an inefficient container is an effective method 
    of optimization of complex algorithms. In order to support 
    this method the C++ standard library should offer a wide 
    variety of general and specialized interchangeable containers. 
    <p>

    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    STL extensions
    </h4>

    <p>
    The advanced data structures can help solve the discussed problems 
    and extend the STL facilities through a set of efficient 
    algorithms that is wider than that of basic data structures. 
    The useful reformulation of this advantage sounds as follows: 
    the advanced data structures have fewer inefficient operations 
    that cause performance problems and interface inconsistencies of 
    the standard containers.     
    </p> 
    
    <p>
    For example, one augmented array based B+ tree of the 
    namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> efficiently supports 
    interfaces of both sequences and associative containers 
    that are supported by several data structures in the C++03 STL. 
    This B+ tree provides efficient random and sequential access to 
    elements by positions and by keys along with logarithmic time 
    general update functions, such as <code>insert()</code> and 
    <code>erase()</code> a single element anywhere within a container, 
    <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code>. 
    Each variant of an STL container of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    obtains this wide set of efficient facilities. 
    </p>

    <p>
    This powerful feature of advanced data structures gives the new 
    containers the key adavantage over the standard containers. 
    The containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> achieve 
    a new level of generalization of mathematical concepts and 
    solutions with the high efficiency of programming implementations.
    </p>  

        
    <a name="overvw"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Overview of namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    </h4>

    <p>    
    The C++ standard library specifies the interfaces of the container and 
    iterator types and allows various implementation alternatives 
    using the most efficient data structures and proper design patterns. 
    The class of advanced data structures is much wider than the class of 
    linear data structures and basic search trees used to formulate 
    the requirements for the C++ standard containers and iterators. 
    The augmented B+ and red black trees appear to be particularly 
    attractive for the extension of the STL facilities. 
    These data structures can be used to develop general and 
    specialized containers with improved efficiency of specific 
    algorithms, bidirectional and random access iterators.     
    One advanced data structure can support a number of interfaces of 
    the C++ standard containers and can add new efficient extensions. 
    For these reasons, all the classes of STL containers 
    of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> are container 
    adapters with the behaviour and performance guarantees 
    defined by the underlying containers. Most of the member 
    functions of a container adapter simply call the corresponding 
    member functions of an underlying container. 
    </p> 

    <p>
    The namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> offers five class templates 
    that support interfaces of the C++03 standard containers:     
    </p>    
<pre>
    sequence , 
    map      , 
    multimap , 
    set      , 
    multiset ;
</pre>
    <p>
    The class <code>sequence</code> defines a union of interfaces of the 
    standard sequences. All other classes implement interfaces of the matching 
    standard associative containers. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the current version of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    the advanced data structures supporting the interfaces of 
    the C++03 standard containers with extensions 
    are represented by two augmented array based B+ trees. 
    In a class of a container adapter a template-argument 
    for a template-parameter of a basic container 
    type can be one of the following classes:
    </p>
<pre>
    bp_tree_array     , 
    bp_tree_array_acc ; 
</pre>

    <p>
    Each of these two classes can be used to generate an STL 
    container class from any sequence and associative container adapter. 
    Thus, the current version of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    can be used to instantiate 10 classes of STL containers. 
    The previously developed 
    <a href="https://github.com/vstadnik/stl_ext_adv">dynamically allocated B+ trees</a> 
    have been excluded, because they are less efficient than 
    the array based B+ trees. With those classes of basic containers 
    the total number of STL containers would be 24. 
    These B+ trees can be added in the future. 
    </p>

    <h4>
    Class <code>bp_tree_array</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
    The class <code>bp_tree_array</code> implements a general purpose 
    array based sequence. For a wide range of applications 
    this class represents the default basic container of 
    the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code>. Any STL container 
    adapter using the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    obtains random access iterators and a number of 
    member functions with the improved efficiency 
    against standard containers. 
    As any other sequence a <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    can store elements with multiple or unique keys in the order 
    specified by a comparison object. Thus, associative 
    containers using the class <code>bp_tree_array</code>    
    can take advantage of the efficient algorithms developed 
    for sequences and random access iterators. 
    </p>    

   
    <h4>
    Container <code>sequence</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
    The class <code>std_ext_adv::sequence</code> supports the union of 
    interfaces of the C++03 sequence containers: <code>std::list</code>, 
    <code>std::deque</code> and <code>std::vector</code>. 
    This new container can replace in algorithms any of these 
    standard containers. A <code>sequence</code> supports:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>random access iterators. 
    <li>logarithmic time insert and erase operations for a single element anywhere within the container. 
    <li>logarithmic time splice and split operations for any ranges of consecutive elements and any positions in the containers involved. 
    </ul>

    
    <h4>
    Associative containers
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    All the associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    provide efficient access to elements by their keys and by positions. 
    These containers support: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>logarithmic time search operations using keys of the container elements. 
    <li>random access iterators. 
    <li>logarithmic time insert and erase operations for a single element anywhere within the container. 
    <li>logarithmic time split operations in the general case and logarithmic time merge operations in special cases. 
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4>
    Move semantics
    </h4>    
    
    <p>
    The key feature of the move semantics functions of sequences is that 
    they do not change the total number of elements in the containers involved. 
    If a user algorithm can avoid or reduce the number of copy operations 
    move semantics provides a significant performance benefit. 
    The group of these functions in the C++03 is represented by the 
    <code>swap()</code> and <code>splice()</code> functions, 
    see the proposal to add move semantics 
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1377.htm">N1377</a>. 
    The latter function is supported by <code>std::list</code> only 
    and has linear complexity for an arbitrary range of elements. 
    The sequences of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> extend 
    move semantics of the standard containers by providing 
    the member functions <code>splice()</code> and <code>split()</code> 
    that guarantee logarithmic complexity in the worst case. 
    For an application of these functions to strings, 
    see the section <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All the associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    support the member function <code>split()</code> in the same way as 
    sequences. However, instead of the function <code>splice()</code>, 
    these containers provide the member function <code>merge()</code>. 
    For associative containers with multiple equivalent elements this 
    function has the same effect as the function <code>splice()</code>. 
    For associative containers that store unique elements the function 
    <code>merge()</code> has the effect of the union operation. 
    In the special cases that are implemented through the function 
    <code>splice()</code> the complexity of the function <code>merge()</code> 
    is logarithmic. 
    </p>        


    <h4>
    Efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code> adds to 
    the functionality of the class <code>bp_tree_array</code> 
    the efficient algorithm for the member function 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. The function calculates the sum of 
    the values of consecutive container elements using 
    <i>O(log N)</i> operations in the worst case, 
    where <i>N</i> is the number of the consecutive elements. 
    The function is supported by every STL container adapter.         
    This algorithm is fundamental to many practically important 
    applications, such as the numerical integration, the data 
    analysis, the statistics etc., see the section 
    <a href="examples.html">Examples</a> for more details. 
    </p>


    <h4>
    Optimized storage management
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    An array based B+ tree of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    implements a partition of an array into a list of sub-arrays 
    connected to a B-tree and takes control of the lifetime of container elements. 
    A container based on the array based B+ tree allocates memory 
    blocks of a constant size as the number of elements increases and 
    automatically releases unused empty blocks as the number of elements decreases. 
    In some aspects, the array based B+ tree represents 
    an enhanced pool allocator that solves 
    <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=184403791">
    storage management problems</a>
    of the standard array based containers. 
    The new containers do not have the problem of exponential storage growth and 
    do not require from a user algorithm to shrink the storage to the optimal capacity.  
    </p>        
        
        
    <h4>
    Advantage of pointer arithmetic
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    Compared to dynamically allocated data structures, including 
    <a href="https://github.com/vstadnik/stl_ext_adv">the previously developed B+ trees</a>, 
    the array based B+ trees of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> use less space. 
    The contiguous arrangement of elements in sub-arrays of these trees maximizes  
    locality of reference. These factors improve efficiency of 
    search operations and sequential access to data stored in a container. 
    The new containers support many algorithms with the level of performance 
    close to that of other array based containers, such as <code>std::vector</code>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Many of the proposed STL extensions with a bit different 
    performance guarantees can be achieved using the augmented 
    red black trees. However, these data structures cannot 
    take advantage of the pointer arithmetic. This limitation 
    can be quite important given the fact that the C++11 standard 
    added to the STL new unordered associative containers, 
    <code>forward_list</code> and <code>array</code>. 
    All of these new containers offer more efficient operations 
    due to improved locality of reference compared to 
    dynamically allocated doubly linked lists and red black trees. 
    </p>
    
    
    <h4>
    Improved representation of sequences
    </h4>

    <p>
    The fact that one basic container of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    supports all the types of the C++03 sequences and associative containers 
    shows the potential of the advanced data structures. 
    The array based B+ trees provide more consistent interfaces 
    for all variants of STL containers and thus improve 
    the representation of a mathematical sequence. 
    In the C++ standard library sequences are not completely 
    interchangeable, since they have differences in 
    the interfaces due to inefficiencies of some 
    supporting operations. 
    </p>


    <h4>
    Expansion of STL application area
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The increase in the number of containers supporting STL interfaces 
    with new efficient algorithms is an important factor for 
    the expansion of the application area of the C++ standard library. 
    The new containers supersede the specialized STL containers, 
    first of all sequences, with reduced interfaces, less efficient 
    member functions and bidirectional iterators. 
    Thus, they can improve the performance of existing  
    algorithms using the standard containers with at least one 
    relatively inefficient operation. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In theory, the most efficient container for a user algorithm 
    provides the minimum total computational cost. However, 
    the theoretical analysis and the calculation of the total cost 
    are not effective for complex algorithms.     
    Moreover, this method has quite significant complication 
    associated with the effect of locality of reference that 
    makes theoretically constant parameters dependent on the number of elements.     
    The most reasonable practical option is the development 
    of a generic solution using interchangeable containers. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>    
    The wide set of the efficient member functions offered by 
    the new containers makes them particularly beneficial 
    for algorithms that use various operations of sequential and 
    random access and frequently update data stored in a container.
    In the general case, the wider the set of operations 
    required in a user algorithm the more significant 
    should be the performance gain provided by 
    the new containers against the C++ standard containers. 
    The algorithms that use a small set of container operations 
    will benefit from the specialized containers, such as 
    <code>std::vector</code>, that offer the most efficient 
    member functions and iterators for specific applications. 
    The ideal application for a speciliazed container is an algorithm 
    with frequencies of inefficient operations all equal to zero.

    Performance notes 
    </h4>

    <p>
    Access to a single element of a <code>sequence</code> through 
    the subscript <code>operator[ ]</code> or the member function 
    <code>at()</code> has cost <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case, 
    where <i>N</i> is the container size. Thus, the total cost of 
    sequential processing of all the <code>sequence</code> elements 
    through this operator and member function can reach <i>O(N log N)</i>. 
    For the best performance of sequential processing that guarantees 
    cost <i>O(N)</i> algorithms should access elements through an iterator. 
    This method also offers the advantage of being general, 
    since it can be used not only with a <code>sequence</code>, 
    but also with the associative containers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In addition to this, in algorithms that visit distant elements 
    the random access iterators of the array based B+ trees 
    are less efficient than iterators of <code>std::vector</code>. 
    The operators <code>{+=, -=, +, -}</code>, that change 
    the position of a random access iterator of a B+ tree, 
    in the worst case have computational cost <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    </p>
