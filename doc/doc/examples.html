    The test code for the classes of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    includes numerous examples of relatively simple uses of 
    the new containers and algorithms, 
    see files 
    <code>&quot;test_container.hpp&quot;</code>, 
    <code>&quot;test_common.hpp&quot;</code>,     
    <code>&quot;test_associative.hpp&quot;</code>, 
    <code>&quot;test_sequence.hpp&quot;</code>. 
    This section includes a number of practically useful applications. 
    Despite the fact that most of these applications are not completely trivial, 
    the new containers help develop effective and relatively simple solutions. 
    The aim of this section is to show how to use the new containers in order 
    to reduce the complexity of solutions in specific applications.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to simplify the demo code and focus on the main features of algorithms 
    based on the advanced data structures, the data members of classes specific to 
    numerical problem domains are of type <code>int</code>. The algorithms operating with 
    integral types take advantage of precise values and use relational and equality 
    operators without a tolerance parameter. In practical applications, data types 
    and operations can be parameterized to support generic algorithms.     
    </p>

    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Efficient string algorithms
    </h4>  

    <p>
    The efficient string algorithms and text editors are major applications 
    for advanced and augmented data structures. 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">Rope</a> 
    data structure provides several string operations 
    more efficient than an array or a linked list.     
    An augmented Finger Tree is another data structure with comparable facilities. 
    It is used in the functional programming language Haskell for implementation of the 
    <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/containers/Data-Sequence.html">
    <code>Data.Sequence</code></a> container.     
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The figure 1 of the section 
    <a href="bp_trees_design.html">Design and implementation of B+ trees</a> 
    shows two representations of a string: one using an augmented array based B+ tree 
    and the other one using an array. The efficient string operations offered by 
    the B+ trees can be used through the <code>sequence</code> container of 
    the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code>, see the code in the file 
    <code>&quot;string.cpp&quot;</code>. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The example string type    
    </p>
    
<pre>
    typedef std_ext_adv::sequence&lt;char&gt;    StringChar ;
</pre>
    
    <p>
    can be regarded as an improved <code>std::vector&lt;char&gt;</code> container that 
    supports logarithmic time insert and erase operations for a single element. 
    In addition to this, an algorithm using this container obtains efficient 
    logarithmic time splice and split operations that eliminate unnecessary and 
    costly copy operations. This is why compared to <code>std::string</code>, 
    <code>StringChar</code> offers a set of much more efficient operations for strings. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A <code>std::string</code> can be converted to a <code>StringChar</code> 
    through its constructor     
    </p>
    
<pre>
    StringChar    string( std_str.begin(), std_str.end() ) ; 
</pre>
    
    <p>
    alternatively, it can be inserted directly before a required position     
    </p>                            

<pre>
    string . insert( pos, std_str.begin(), std_str.end() ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    Similar conversions can be used to return a processed string or text 
    from <code>StringChar</code> to <code>std::string</code>.
    </p>                            

    <p>
    The example functions in the file <code>&quot;string.cpp&quot;</code> 
    demonstrate string operations based on the efficient move semantics algorithms. 
    These algorithms do not copy and do not erase strings and substrings involved. 
    They just move a range of characters from one string into another. 
    Thus, each of the three operations discussed below has logarithmic 
    computational complexity. 
    </p>                            

    <p>
    The string concatenation is just a special case of the splice operation:     
    </p>                            

<pre>
    string_a . splice ( string_a.end() , string_b ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    A substring can be easily obtained using the member function <code>spit()</code>:
    </p>                            

<pre>
    string . split( pos_a , pos_b , sub_string ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The replace substring operation applies both of the discussed operations:     
    </p>                            

<pre>
    pos = string . split ( pos_a , pos_b , sub_str ) ; 
    pos = string . splice( pos , sub_str_new ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The <code>split()</code> function extracts a substring to be replaced, 
    then the <code>splice()</code> function moves a new substring at 
    the position of the extracted substring. Note that this example code 
    uses updated iterators returned by <code>StringChar</code> member functions. 
    This code addresses the problem of invalidation of iterators of 
    array based containers, for more details see the section 
    <a href="iterators.html">Random access iterators of array based B+ trees</a>. 
    </p>                            

    <p>
    In a text editor <code>StringChar</code> can represent a long text. 
    This type of a string efficiently supports all main editing operations: 
    cut, copy, paste, delete, find, replace, etc. The high performance and 
    space optimized move semantics facilities are particularly beneficial for 
    undo and redo commands with large text blocks.     
    </p>                            

    <p>
    In practical applications it is important to minimize the number of conversions 
    between different types of strings to obtain the best performance. Unfortunately, 
    the STL design for strings is inconsistent with other standard containers, 
    since many string algorithms are implemented as member functions of 
    the class <code>std::basic_string</code>. The same algorithms using iterator ranges 
    could be directly applied to both standard stings and strings based on advanced 
    data structures. These variants of string algorithms would considerably reduce 
    the frequency of conversions to and from <code>std::string</code> and 
    improve performance of user algorithms.

    <a name="ex_interval"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Fast counting of intersections of one interval with sequence of intervals 
    </h4>  
    
    <p>
    The example in the file <code>&quot;interval.cpp&quot;</code> demonstrates how to use 
    the new associative containers with random access iterators to find the total 
    number of intersections between an input interval and a sequence of intervals. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The main advantage of the algorithm developed for this example is its low computational cost. 
    It finds any number of intersections in <i>O(log N)</i> time, where <i>N</i> is the number of 
    intervals in a sequence. Note that this algorithm does not return a result list with all 
    intersected intervals. This is a different problem. An algorithm for this problem has 
    the computational cost of at least the number of intersections, which can be much greater 
    than <i>O(log N)</i>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The algorithm of this example has been developed for semi-open intervals with 
    endpoints <code>[a, b)</code>, <code>a<=b</code>:
    </p>
<pre>
    class Interval 
    {
    public:
        explicit 
        Interval ( int  _a=0 , int  _b=0 ) : a ( _a ) , b ( _b ) 
        {
            if ( b < a ) std::swap ( a , b ) ; 
        }         
        
        int     A ( ) const { return a ; } 
        int     B ( ) const { return b ; } 

    private:
        int     a ; 
        int     b ; 
    } ;    
</pre>

    <p>
    The type <code>VectInterval</code> 
    </p>
<pre>
    typedef std::vector&lt;Interval&gt;   VectInterval ;
</pre> 
    <p>
    represents a collection of intervals. In generic algorithms a collection, such as 
    <code>VectInterval</code>, can store either unordered or ordered objects of any size 
    and any type, provided that each object represents an interval. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In order to test the correctness of the new efficient algorithm, the example 
    includes linear algorithm of counting of intersections of intervals 
    </p>
<pre>
    int  CountIntersections 
    ( 
        Interval const &        interval_x  , 
        VectInterval const &    vect_interval
    ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    For the method of linear counting, a result of the intersection of two arbitrary 
    intervals is determined by the function: 
    </p>
<pre>
    bool Intersect ( Interval const &  x , Interval const &  y ) 
    {
        return ( x.A() < y.B() ) && ( y.A() < x.B() ) ; 
    }
</pre>

    <p>
    The method of fast counting of all intersections between an input interval and a sequence 
    of intervals is based on a simple fact. The total number of intervals in the sequence is 
    equal to the sum of two numbers of intervals that intersect and do not intersect input 
    interval <code>x</code>. For semi-open intervals with endpoints <code>[a, b)</code>, 
    the total number of intersections <code>n_x</code> can be calculated by the formula: 
    </p>
<pre>
	n_x = n - n_a - n_b ;     
</pre>
    <p>
    where <code>n</code> is the total number of intervals in the sequence, <code>n_a</code> 
    is the number of intervals in the sequence with upper endpoint <code>b</code> 
    such that <code>( i.b <= x.a )</code>, <code>n_b </code> is the number of intervals in 
    the sequence with lower endpoint <code>a</code> such that <code>( i.a >= x.b )</code>. 
    Both <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> are the numbers of intervals that do not 
    intersect input interval <code>x</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The efficiency of this method is defined by the efficiency of the calculation of values of 
    <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code>, since the total number of intervals in a sequence
    <code>n</code> is obtained in constant time. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If the intervals and their endpoints are stored in unordered containers, the required numbers 
    <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> can be obtained in linear time only. 
    In order to improve the performance, the method uses two ordered sequences: the first one stores 
    the lower endpoints from every interval, while the second one stores the upper endpoints. 
    The ordered sequences support the search for boundaries of subsets of intervals with 
    logarithmic time. The calculation of <code>n_a</code> and <code>n_b</code> through random access 
    iterators pointing to the boundaries of the subsets has constant cost. This is why the performance 
    of this method is logarithmic in the worst case and does not depend on the total number of 
    intersections of intervals. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> offers associative containers with random access 
    iterators required for the implementation of the fast counting of intersections of intervals. 
    The type <code>MultiSetInt</code> 
    </p>
<pre>
    typedef std_ext_adv::multiset&lt;int&gt; MultiSetInt ;    
</pre>
    <p>
    represents a collection of intervals ordered by the lower or upper endpoint of an interval. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> support 
    logarithmic time search for boundaries of the required subsets through 
    the member functions <code>lower_bound()</code> and <code>upper_bound()</code> 
    along with constant time counting of intervals in these subsets through 
    random access iterators. The efficient algorithm of counting of 
    intersections with logarithmic running time is implemented in the method: 
    </p>
<pre>
    int  CountIntersections
        (
            Interval const &        interval_x  ,
            MultiSetInt const &     mset_a      ,
            MultiSetInt const &     mset_b
        )
    {
        int     n     = mset_a . size ( ) ;
        int     n_a   = mset_b . upper_bound ( interval_x.A() ) - 
                        mset_b . begin ( ) ;
        int     n_b   = mset_a . end ( ) - 
                        mset_a . lower_bound ( interval_x.B() ) ;
        int     count = n - n_a - n_b ;
        return  count ;
    }
</pre>
    
    <p>
    This example algorithm of the fast counting of intersections of intervals 
    can be extended for even more advanced applications. This can be achieved 
    through associative containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code>, 
    which support random access iterators and the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. For any required subset of intervals, an algorithm 
    based on these containers can obtain not only the number of intervals, but 
    also the total time, the mean value and standard deviation. The computational 
    cost of obtaining of all of these parameters is logarithmic. 
    </p>
    
  
    <a name="ex_mean_val"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">    
    Mean value
    </h4>    
    
    <p>
    This example is quite simple and useful in numerous problems. It also demonstrates 
    how the performance of an algorithm based on new containers is improved compared to 
    C++ standard containers and algorithms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For any container, which uses the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    of the class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code>, the mean value of <i>N</i> 
    consecutive elements can be determined as shown in this demo code:
    </p>
<pre>
    sum  = data_container . accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , 0 ) ; 
    n    = pos_b - pos_a ; 
    mean = sum / n ;
</pre>

    <p>
    This method has the total cost of only <i>O(log N)</i> in the worst case. 
    The mean value requires the calculation of two values: the sum of elements and 
    the number of elements. 
    The efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> finds the first 
    value for <i>O(log N)</i> steps. 
    The cost associated with the second value is negligible, since random 
    access iterators allow the determination of the number of consecutive 
    elements in constant time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The support of random access iterators is an important detail in achieving 
    the low computational cost of the calculation of the mean value. If, for a example, a 
    container would implement a fast algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> and bidirectional 
    iterators, the total cost of the calculation of the mean value would increase to 
    <i>O(N)</i> as a result of counting elements by the method
    </p>
<pre>
    n = std::distance ( pos_a , pos_b ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    For the C++ standard containers the best performance of the calculation of 
    the mean value can be achieved with <code>std::vector</code>, since it supports 
    random access iterators. A method based on this container has total cost <i>O(N)</i>, 
    which is the cost of calculating the sum of elements using the STL method 
    </p>
<pre>
    sum = std::accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , 0 ) ;
</pre>

    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Advanced examples using fast algorithm <cod>accumulate()</code> 
    </h4>  
    
    <p>
    The rest of this section discusses several practical applications of sequences based on 
    the class <code>bp_tree_array_acc</code> of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code>. 
    These examples demonstrate that the containers with random access iterators and 
    the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> provide very efficient facilities 
    for analysis of data. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The common feature of these examples using fast algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    is the calculation of sums and mean values of several parameters of a sequence of objects. 
    In these applications, the most straightforward method is to create a container with the fast 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> for every parameter to be processed by a user algorithm. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The examples demonstrate how to solve a problem using only one container 
    for all parameters to be summed up in a user algorithm. In many practical 
    applications, this can be achieved with a user defined type, which stores 
    values of all parameters required in the algorithm. The method based on 
    a single container with a user defined type for all parameters provides at least 
    two advantages: optimized space usage and improved structure of a user algorithm. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The demo code shows how this method works with the containers of the namespace 
    <code>std_ext_adv</code> using both the efficient and the standard algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. The results of these algorithms are compared to test 
    the correctness of the implementation. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All the example algorithms based on containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> have the same theoretical performance. 
    In every example, a value of a sum is calculated in logarithmic time and a number of elements 
    within a specified range - in constant time.     
    </p>
    
    
    <a name="ex_rectangl"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Mean values of parameters of rectangles and numerical integration
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The code in the file <code>"rectangle_area.cpp"</code> demonstrates how to use the fast algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> to calculate sums and mean values of several parameters of 
    a sequence of rectangles: the width, length, perimeter and area. This example includes 
    the numerical integration as a particular case. 
    </p>
    
    <p>        
    In the group of examples using one container with the efficient summation algorithm, 
    this example is the most advanced and illustrative in terms of implementation details. 
    This is why it is given the most detailed consideration and explanation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The class <code>RectArea</code> has three data members to store and calculate sums of 
    all the required parameters: 
    </p>
<pre>
    class RectArea 
    {
    ...
        int     width  ; 
        int     length ; 
        int     area   ; 
    } ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The width and length of a rectangle must be provided by a user algorithm. 
    The area of the rectangle is calculated automatically using the provided 
    values of the width and length. Storing the area value is an important detail 
    of this programming solution. In many similar applications involving 
    the processing of rectangles, it is sufficient to store in the class 
    <code>Rectangle</code> values of only two independent attributes: 
    </p>
<pre>
    class Rectangle 
    {
    ...
        double      length ; 
        double      width  ; 
        double      Area ( ) const { return length*width ; } 
    } ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The value of the derived attribute area can be calculated in constant time 
    using the length and width of the rectangle. Within this alternative approach, 
    the area value is not stored in order to save space. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The list of data members of the class <code>RectArea</code> cannot be reduced to 
    two independent parameters only, if a user algorithm calculates the sum of areas. 
    In the general case, this value cannot be obtained from the sums of the lengths 
    and widths. On the other hand, the sum and mean value of the perimeter can be 
    calculated using the length and width sums. Thus, this parameter does not require 
    a special data member in the class <code>RectArea</code>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When specifying the interface of the class <code>RectArea</code>, it is necessary 
    to define a number of arithmetic operators. A B+ tree supporting the efficient 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> requires that a user defined type overload 
    the following operators: 
    </p>
<pre>
    class RectArea 
    {
    ...
        RectArea &  operator += ( const RectArea &  x ) ;
        RectArea &  operator -= ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
        RectArea    operator +  ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
        RectArea    operator -  ( const RectArea &  x ) ; 
    } ;
</pre>

    <p>
    Through these operators, implementation functions of the B+ tree update 
    cached data in internal nodes when the tree is modified and support 
    the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. Overloading four 
    operators is a relatively strict requirement, since the summation of 
    elements with the standard algorithm <code>std::accumulate()</code> 
    requires overloading only one binary <code>operator+</code>.

    The discussed data members and arithmetic operators of the class <code>RectArea</code> 
    meet the minimum requirements for an element of a sequence with the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> for this example. In practical applications, this class can have 
    other data members and interface operations. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The demo code shows two methods for the calculation of the sums. 
    For efficient calculation in logarithmic running time, a user algorithm 
    should call the member function <code>accumulate()</code>: 
    </p>
<pre>
    sum_rect_area = seqceRectArea . accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_rect_area_0 ) ;    
</pre>

    <p>
    The standard algorithm <code>std::accumulate()</code> obtains the same result in linear time: 
    </p>
<pre>
    sum_rect_area = std::accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_rect_area_0 ) ;    
</pre>

    <p>
    The second method can be helpful at the development stage of a project to test 
    the correctness of the design and implementation of new classes and algorithms. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The values of sums of specific parameters of a sequence of rectangles can now be 
    obtained through the interface member functions of the class <code>RectArea</code>: 
    </p>
<pre>
    sum_width  = sum_rect_area . Width ( ) ; 
    sum_length = sum_rect_area . Length( ) ; 
    sum_area   = sum_rect_area . Area  ( ) ; 
</pre>

    <p>
    The number of elements in the range of calculations is obtained in constant time 
    through the distance between random access iterators: 
    </p>
<pre>
    n = pos_b - pos_a ;     
</pre>

    <p>
    The mean values of the width, length and area are obtained from the corresponding sums: 
    </p>
<pre>
    mean_width  = sum_width  / n ;
    mean_length = sum_length / n ;
    mean_area   = sum_area   / n ;
</pre>

    <p>
    As it has been discussed above the main feature of the selected method is 
    the calculation of several sums using one container with the efficient 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code>. Despite only the width and length of 
    a rectangle are independent parameters, the class <code>RectArea</code> 
    has a special data member to store the area too. In contrast to the area 
    calculation, the mean value of the perimeter does not require storing 
    a special sum as a data member of the class <code>RectArea</code>. 
    It can be derived from results obtained for the width and length 
    using their sums or mean values, e.g.: 
    </p>
<pre>
    mean_perimeter = 2.0 * ( mean_width + mean_length ) ;    
</pre>

    <p>
    This example can be used to implement the rectangle method of the numerical integration 
    of a function. The approximate value of the definite integral is provided by the sum of 
    rectangle areas <code>sum_area</code>. The width of a rectangle is a variable parameter, 
    which means that a user algorithm can sample the function with both equal and variable 
    steps between abscissas of data points. In the simplest cases when all data points are 
    equally spaced it is sufficient to store in a container only area values without using 
    the class <code>RectArea</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The code of this example can be also adapted to support the other widely used integration 
    method of the trapezoidal rule. The high accuracy methods of the numerical integration 
    sum up values of a function multiplied by their weights. The example of the weighted mean 
    value, which is discussed below, shows how the sums can be calculated in logarithmic time 
    instead of linear. 
    </p>        
    
    <p>
    The important feature of the containers of the namespace <code>std_ext_adv</code> 
    is the low cost of all the basic operations. The computer algorithms of the numerical 
    integrations based on these containers can take advantage of the fast update operations 
    in order to efficiently find the best approximation of a function. The insertion of 
    new data or interpolation points improves the accuracy of the approximation. 
    The deletion of redundant points reduces the size of approximation data and 
    saves space.

    Mean value and standard deviation 
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The mean value and the standard deviation are the key parameters in the statistical 
    analysis of data. Practical applications processing large and huge data sets demand 
    the most efficient algorithms for calculating these parameters. This example shows 
    how to use one container with the efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    to obtain these two important parameters for any number of consecutive elements 
    of a sequence. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In this example, see file <code>&quot;standard_deviation.cpp&quot;</code>, 
    the type of an element of a sequence with the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code> is represented by the class <code>ElementValue</code>: 
    </p>
<pre>
    class ElementValues
    {
    public:
        explicit
        ElementValues ( int v=0 ) ; 

        int     Value ( )        const ; 
        int     ValueSquared ( ) const ;  

        ElementValues &  operator += ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues &  operator -= ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues    operator +  ( const ElementValues &  x ) ;
        ElementValues    operator -  ( const ElementValues &  x ) ; 

    private:
        int     value ; 
        int     value_squared ; 
    } ;
</pre>

    <p>
    This class stores both the value of an element and its squared value. 
    A user algorithm provides only the value of an element. The squared value 
    is calculated and updated automatically through the constructor and 
    operators of this class. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    From an implementation point of view, this example algorithm can be 
    regarded as a simplified variant of the algorithm processing parameters of 
    a sequence of rectangles. In fact, the previous solution can support 
    the calculations of mean and standard deviation values of elements provided 
    that both the width and the length of a rectangle, more exactly square, 
    represent the value of an element and the area represents the squared value 
    of the element. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The example code shows how to obtain the sum of values of elements and 
    the sum of squared values using both the standard and efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. These calculations apply the efficient algorithm:
    </p>
<pre>
    sum_elem_values = seqce_values . accumulate ( pos_a , pos_b , sum_elem_values_0 ) ;
    sum_x           = sum_elem_values . Value ( ) ;
    sum_x_2         = sum_elem_values . ValueSquared ( ) ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The mean value and standard deviation are derived from the obtained sums 
    and the number of elements:
    </p>
<pre>
    n         = pos_b - pos_a ; 
    mean      = sum_x/n ; 
    variance  = sum_x_2/n - mean*mean ; 
    deviation = sqrt ( variance ) ;  
</pre>

    
    <a name="ex_allequal"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Testing if any number of consecutive elements are all equal 
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The efficient calculation of the mean value and standard deviation provides 
    the following interesting result. The standard deviation is a measure of 
    the distribution of data. If the value of this parameter is zero, then 
    all the elements of the sequence have the same value. This conclusion is 
    particularly important for unordered sequences. The calculation of the sums 
    of values and squared values has logarithmic cost. Hence, the efficient 
    calculation of the standard deviation enables the user algorithm to test 
    if any number <i>N</i> of the consecutive elements are all equal 
    in <i>O(log N)</i> time. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In practical applications, it is necessary to minimize numerical errors of 
    floating data types. Some improvement can be achieved by eliminating 
    the division by the number of elements from the variance calculations. 
    In this case, the test is reduced to the comparison of the sums of values 
    and squared values: 
    </p>
<pre>    
    // test if all elements have the same value
    if ( n*sum_x_2 == sum_x*sum_x ) 
    ...
</pre>

    <p>
    This method can be suitable for integral types and user defined types 
    based on integral types. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note also that for ordered sequences, the test if all the elements 
    in a range have the same value is trivial. It only compares the values of 
    elements at two specified positions. For non-empty semi-open range 
    <code>[pos_a, pos_b)</code>, the test is: 
    </p>
<pre>    
    if ( *pos_a == *(pos_b-1) )
    ...  
</pre>

    <p>
    This test has constant cost. For an unordered sequence, without the efficient 
    algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> the test takes linear time. 
    </p>
    
    
    <a name="ex_weighted"></a>
    <h4 class="h4_f1">
    Weighted mean value
    </h4>
    
    <p>
    The weighted mean value is an important characteristic and method for 
    the analysis of large data sets. For histogram data the weight parameter 
    represents a frequency of a value. For a large data set with pre-calculated 
    mean values of subsets the weight represents a number of elements in a data subset. 
    This parameter significantly improves the running time of the calculation of 
    the mean value of the whole data set. With weights and mean values of subsets 
    the time reduces from the total number of elements to the total number of 
    subsets only. The example in file <code>&quot;weighted_mean.cpp&quot;</code> 
    demonstrates how to improve the performance of calculations of the weighted 
    mean value even further using a sequence with the efficient algorithm 
    <code>accumulate()</code>. The running time of this algorithm is logarithmic 
    function of the number of subsets. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The type of a container element is declared and defined in 
    the class <code>WeightedValue</code>. It includes the three data members 
    to store the value of an element, its weight and contribution, 
    which is defined as the product of the value by its weight: 
    </p>
<pre>    
    class WeightedValue 
    {
    ...
        int     value  ; 
        int     weight ; 
        int     contribution ; 
    } ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The value of an element and its weight must be provided by a user algorithm. 
    The contribution of the value is automatically calculated and updated 
    using the value and its weight. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The comparison shows that this example has a very close similarity 
    with the example of the calculation of the mean values of parameters 
    for a sequence of rectangles. When the length, width and area of 
    a rectangle represent the value, weight and contribution, respectively, of 
    an element, the examples become almost identical. This fact suggests that 
    in practical applications, code reuse can be achieved through 
    the parameterization of algorithms. This fact also allows us to omit 
    the discussion of many implementation details of this example. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The major specific feature of this example is that the calculation of 
    the weighted mean value uses two accumulated sums of 
    the contributions and weights:     
    </p>
<pre>    
    mean_weighted = sum_contribution / sum_weight ;
</pre>

    <p>
    The arithmetic mean value is derived from the sum of all values and 
    the total number of the values. The arithmetic mean is a special case of 
    the weighted mean when every weight is equal to one. However, the total 
    number of elements does not require any special summation, since it can be 
    determined in constant time through random access iterators as discussed 
    above in the example "Mean value and standard deviation". 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It is interesting to compare the performance improvement of the standard 
    and new methods of the weighted mean value in the calculation of 
    the mean value of a data set. For example, if a data set contains 
    <code>1,000,000</code> elements arranged into <code>1,000</code> subsets 
    with pre-calculated mean values, then the standard algorithm improves 
    the performance by the factor <code>1,000</code>. This improvement is substantial 
    for any practical application. The new efficient algorithm <code>accumulate()</code> 
    has logarithmic running time. For this reason its performance improvement 
    is not so significant as for linear algorithms. For the same example, it is 
    <code>log(1,000,000)/log(1,000)</code>, which gives the factor <code>2.0</code>.
